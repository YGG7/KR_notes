C provides getchar() and putchar() as the user input/output interface.
Comparing with InputStream and OutputStream in Java, input and output methods in C do not specify the source, destination and whether use buffer explicitly.
getchar() and putchar() implicitly set console as input source and output destination, and enable buffer.
