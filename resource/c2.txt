It's worth noting that \n is not EOF. When we enter \n in the terminal, the program will push the buffer (including \n itself) to the while loop including getchar().
Then getchar() will read every character till the buffer is empty, and getchar() will block on it.
Although the behaviors of this 'echo' program like it's processing strings, it can only recognize characters one by one.
